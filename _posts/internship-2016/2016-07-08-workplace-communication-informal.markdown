Workplace communication is very important. For companies to operate efficiently and be productive they have to ensure it is necessary to ensure that its employees are communicating effectively. In this blog post, I'm going to share some of the ways we communicate at my internship site and how it has changed my perspective on doing productive work.

The most commonly used tool for communicating with each other is Slack. Slack has revolutionized workplace communications in many manners. It takes the formality out of writing emails but also keeps conversation organized, unlike messaging applications. We have different channels for different projects, and I can easily reach out for help to any of the projects managers, or mentors through personal messages without disrupting the workflow. We also have a #random channel and what I love most about this channel is someone will post a random gif every hour using a giphy robot installed in Slack. When you look at the giphy and laugh it relieves the stress you have built up sitting in the same chair, staring at the monitor, and crunching out code. I think, allowing freedom of expression using text, images, videos, gifs or any other form of communication creates good connections between employees.

Enough about Slack. In-person communication is also very important. Most of the in-person communication takes place during meetings. What I like most about working here is the flat hierarchy in communication. I can go up to anyone and ask questions that I have and even the CEO has dropped by my table many times asking me how I was doing or what I was working on. This really boosts your morale, when you do not hesitate to ask questions.

I believe Berea has perfectly prepared me for working in this kind of environment because it is very easy to reach out to your professors, advisors, or peers in Berea. The ability I developed at Berea to ask questions without much hesitation has proven very helpful, and I continue to improve that here.

So, this post was mainly about informal communication. In the next post, I'll write about all the formal ways we communicate to keep each other accountable.
