I have always wanted to start a blog. But every time I find an excuse to not blog. A lot of people say that blogging is no longer a trend with this massive network of social media around us. However, I don’t think it’s true. I think blogging can be a very powerful tool to express and share your thoughts.

So, you might be wondering what got me started? Well, this semester at Berea College I am taking a course in Software Engineering, where we will be learning and contributing to the world of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). As a part of this course, we are required to blog about our work and share with the world what a class of undergraduate is trying to accomplish. After all, isn’t Open Source about sharing your work with others?

I have not decided what other objects I would like to accomplish through this blog. But you will definitely find my posts about my FOSS class project. I might also use this Blog as a platform to share my other works and what this tiny creature in this BIG world is trying to accomplish. This blog will also be a motivation for me to start building my personal website and share my work and create my network.

And yes, if you would like to know more about don’t forget to visit my About page. Also, feel free to drop me a message on the Contact page.

Thanks for reading.

Signing off,

Ishwar.
