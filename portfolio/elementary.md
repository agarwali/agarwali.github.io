## Inspiration
As teaching assistants for the Computer Science Department we found students not receiving the right help and at the right time to succeed.

## What it does
This application reduces the barriers between students who need help and those willing to help them, by introducing IBM's Watson which tries to answer the student's question if a TA is absent and resents them solutions that increases their inquisitiveness.

## How we built it
A python flask application.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning how to use and train IBM's Watson and final deployment

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to use IBM's Watson and put it together with a working prototype in less than 24 hours.

## What's next for Elementary
Add more subjects that students get help from and run a beta testing on our campus.

## Built With
flask
python
